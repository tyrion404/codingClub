      I remember when I was building a prototype product as part of a semester-long project in 2.009 (a mechanical engineering class) at MIT. I was part of a team of about a dozen engineering students working furiously to finish our new imagining of a safer walker. You know the things: metal frames found in senior care facilities with bright yellow tennis balls fashioned to the ends. But with this new walker, an unfortunate fall victim could drop the seat to the floor and scoot onto it. The seat could be driven back up to a seated position – which we had learned was typically enough for the person to recover from a fall.
